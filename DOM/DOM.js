/* 
The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object-orented representation of a web page, where each element of the page,
such as button, image or text, is represented as an object with its own set of properties and methods.
The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents, that allows us to use JS to access and update
the content, structure, and style of the webpage.

The DOM represents a document as a tree of nodes. The word "node" refers to a single point in a data structure, and 
in the case of DOM, it represents an element or a piece of text on the webpage. Each node is a object representing a
part of the document. The tree-like structure of the DOM is formed by parent-child relationships between the nodes,
with each element containing other elements, which can be thought of as child nodes.

For example, in an HTML document, a node would represent an element such as paragraph <p>Hello world</p>,
and the text "Hello World" would be a child node of the paragraph node.
