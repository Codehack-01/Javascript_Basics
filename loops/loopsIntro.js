/* We've seen how to use array methods like forEach and map to iterate over the elements in an array.
In programming, we call this looping. To loop meand to repeat a process untill a condition is met. It is a fundametal
concept in programming and is used in several ways. JavaScript has different types of loops, apart from the Array
methods we've seen, which allows for more control over the looping process. These are the for loop, the while loop,
and the do...while loop. Let's take a look at each of these */
